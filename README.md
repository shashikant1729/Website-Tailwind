About
</summary>

- Tailwind CSS can be used to style websites in the fastest and easiest way.
  
- Tailwind CSS is basically a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. It is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs without any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override.
  
- The beauty of this thing called tailwind is it doesn’t impose design specifications or how your site should look, you simply bring tiny components together to construct a user interface that is unique. What Tailwind simply does is take a ‘raw’ CSS file, process this CSS file over a configuration file, and produces an output.
